# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that can have other functions as parameters and/or returns a function

2. Jest: JS testing framework -  I still don't really get it 

3. Objects: A variable that can contain many properties with many values 

4. Method: Actions that can be performed on objects 

5. Classes: templates for objects. They are a type of function that contains data and behavior.
